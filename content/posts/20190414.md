I tried the puzzle saying that it cannot be solved by bottom 10% of software engineers in Web industry [^1](#1), created by Jabba ([@nodenodenode1](https://twitter.com/nodenodenode1)).
I record how I solved it as follows.

# Process to solve it

Understanding curl command and HTTP requests was the key to solve this puzzle.

```
$ curl http://challenge-your-limits.herokuapp.com/call/me  
{"message":"Almost! It's not GET. Keep trying."}  
$ curl -d "" http://challenge-your-limits.herokuapp.com/call/me  
{"message":"Great! Please register as /challenge_users"}  
$ curl -d "" http://challenge-your-limits.herokuapp.com/challenge_users  
{"message":"Validation Error, [:name, \"can't be blank\"]"}  
$ curl -d "name=Taku" http://challenge-your-limits.herokuapp.com/challenge_users  
{"message":"Validation Error, [:email, \"can't be blank\"]"}  
$ curl -d "name=Taku&email=foo" http://challenge-your-limits.herokuapp.com/challenge_users  
{"message":"Thanks! Please access to http://challenge-your-limits.herokuapp.com/foo  from your web browser."}  
```

I registered my name (Taku) and comment on the link given by the server.
