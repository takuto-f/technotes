I launched this website using Hugo on Github Pages.
It took me some hours to complete the task.
I write down what happened during this work.

# Environment

* MacBook Pro (Early 2015)
    * macOS (Mojave Version 10.14.x)
    * Xcode (Version 10.1)
    * Git (Version 2.17.2 (Apple Git-113))
    * Homebrew (Version 2.0.2)
    * Go (version go1.11.4 darwin/amd64)
* Github account

# 0. Install Homebrew and Go

I installed Homebrew and Go environment for Hugo.

    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

    $ brew install go

# 1. Install Hugo by Homebrew

    brew install hugo

# 2. Make a Hugo site

## Use a template theme

# 3. Check the website on local

I had a problem that I couldn't start the webserver because the PATHs were not set correctly. We need to set them according to the instruction shown when We install Hugo.

# 4. Register and push the directory to Github

It was my first time to commit files to my Github account, so I set my the SSH key according to the following GitHub Help pages.

* [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent - GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

* [Testing your SSH connection - GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection)

# Questions on this work

* Should I clone or add submodule my public directory?
* Should I use SSH or HTTPS when I clone a pre-made theme?

# Future Tasks

- edit config.toml  
- add search function on my website
